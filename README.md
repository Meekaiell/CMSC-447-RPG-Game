# CMSC-447-RPG-Game
Students will create a role-playing game (RPG) system for completing assignments in CMSC 411. The system will contain exercises presented as "side quests" where students can build experience with the course material to prepare for exams. The system will also record aggregate statistics on student performance on exams and how their performance correlates with their "level".
